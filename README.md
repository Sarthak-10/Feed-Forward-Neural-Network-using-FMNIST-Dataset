**About Feed Forward Neural Nets:**

A Feed Forward Neural Network is an artificial neural network in which the connections between nodes does not form a cycle.The feed forward model is the simplest form of neural network as information is only processed in one direction. While the data may pass through multiple hidden nodes, it always moves in one direction and never backwards.

**About FMNIST Dataset:**

Fashion-MNIST(FMNIST) is a dataset consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.The 10 classes are T-shirt/Top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag,and Ankle Boot. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits.
